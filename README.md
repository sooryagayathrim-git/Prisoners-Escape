# Prisoners-Escape
Python program to find the number of prisoners who can escape based on the relative strength of their locks.
This project determines how many prisoners in a line can escape from prison based on the strength of their locks. 
Each prisoner has a lock with a certain strength. A prisoner can escape if their lock is weaker than both of their immediate neighbors. 
Prisoners at the start or end of the line only need to be weaker than their single neighbor. 
The program takes the number of prisoners and their lock strengths as input and outputs the total number of prisoners who can escape.
